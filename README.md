# Japanese Alphabet Training

This project is intended for studying purposes only.

I'm learning Japanese, and it's very important to remember all the symbols, so this is a little game to help me remember them.

You are presented with a symbol and you have to type the romaji equivalent of that symbol, if it is correct, a button appears to lead you to the next one.
